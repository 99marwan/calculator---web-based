# calculator---web-based
A web based application makes simple operations like adding numbers , subtracting , multiplying , division , percent , power and fraction. 
Using vue.js and spring boot.



Assumptions:
- The user can enter only 18 digits as an input.
- When the user enter an input then press on any arithmetic
operation(+,-,*,/) and after that choose one of these
operations (1/𝑥, 𝑥², √𝑥, %, +/-) , he will see the result of these
operations ,But when press on equal or any arithmetic
operation the result will be (sum , subtact , division ,
multiplication) of the input number and the number from
these operations(1/𝑥,𝑥², √𝑥, %, +/-).
For example:
If the input is “5” then he pressed “+” the he pressed “𝑥²”,He
will see “25” on screen , if he pressed “+” he will see “30”On
screen.
- When the user enter an input then press on any arithmetic
operation(+,-,*,/) and after that press equal the result on
screen will be “input number + input number “, and if he
presses equal another time nothing will happen .
For example:
If the input is “5” then he pressed “+” the he pressed “=”,He
will see “10” on screen.
- If the user divides an input by zero, he will see “cannot divide
by zero” and he can not do any operation except clearing or
entering new input.
- If the user gets a square root for a negative input, he will see
“invalid input” and he can not do any operation except
clearing or entering new input.
- C and CE do the same operation.
- % : divide by 100
